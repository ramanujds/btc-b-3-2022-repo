## Practice Statement - Unique Arrays

**A company has revamped the health insurance policy for all its insured employees and has increased their health cover by 20%. In order to provide them this facility, the human resource department needs to collect the data of all insured employees and prepare a unique list of their employee ids.​ Write a program to help the HR manager to create a unique list of employee ids to avoid duplication.​​**

### Example

        int[] salesDepartmentEmpIds = {101,105,106,107,108,109};
